question: 'How to install OTA firmware updates?'
---
1. Download suitable firmware OTA update. Check Discord or forums for links.
2. Compare file signatures with values from [Updates](/headunits/updates/ksw) page (if available) to make sure file is not corrupted.
3. Copy the `Ksw-[...]_OS_v[...]-ota.zip` archive directly to the root of the USB drive.
4. Plug in the USB drive into Head Unit. If you have two USB connectors, use the one without CarPlay label.
5. Head Unit should automatically detect the file and ask if you want to update, select Yes.
