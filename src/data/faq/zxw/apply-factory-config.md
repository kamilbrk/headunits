question: 'How to apply zxw_factory_config.xml file?'
---
Before making any changes, make sure you have a [backup of your original file](/headunits/faq/zxw/pull-factory-config).

1. Use a USB drive with FAT32 formatted partition
2. On the root of the USB drive, create a folder called `OEM`
3. Copy your file into `OEM` folder, so that it's accessible under `/OEM/zxw_factory_config.xml` location
4. Plug in the USB drive into Head Unit (if you have two USB connectors, use the one without CarPlay label)
5. You can now either start/restart the Head Unit to load the file automatically. You should see a toast message indicating that settings were applied. 
6. Alternatively, go to Factory settings, "Profile Import" and tap on "Update" button to load the file manually.
