Changes since `20241129GT_KSW` built 98 days earlier:
- New theme [`KSW_BMW_ID8_GS_DOUBLE`](/headunits/themes/zxw/53-ksw_bmw_id8_gs_double) with `id="53"` with a secondary screen support in the launcher, containing various information like live GPS data
- New theme [`KSW_BENZ_GLC`](/headunits/themes/zxw/54-ksw_benz_glc) with `id="54"` as a second theme so far with navigation bar support, like [`KSW_BENZ_VITO`](/headunits/themes/zxw/52-ksw_benz_vito)
- New theme [`KSW_BENZ_FY3`](/headunits/themes/zxw/55-ksw_benz_fy3) with `id="55"` with blue, green, orange, purple, red and yellow options that looks to be relatively well-supported by most built-in apps. Seems to require `ALS_6208` client value and potentially have a lyrics functionality in the Music app.
- Ivicar app: Vehicle speed display setting (turned on by default) and improvements to automatic file deletion where recording should temporarily pause for 0.1s
- Zlink app updated from `5.4.45` to `5.4.96` with minor UI updates and screen DPI settings for Huawei HiCar mode. Activities are now marked as resizeable.
- New "External mic output" (`<externalMicOutput>`) factory setting in Function section with "I2S" and "AUX" options, which will change output device ID in AudioManager
- New "Mercedes Benz Vito bottom status bar style" (`<benzVitoBottomStyle>`) factory setting in Special Benz section with "Default" and "Temperature Control" options
- Changes in USB connection around host and peripheral modes
- Updated various translations
