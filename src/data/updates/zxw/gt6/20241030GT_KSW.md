Summary:
- Further changes for [`KSW_BENZ_LS`](/headunits/themes/zxw/48-ksw_benz_ls) theme

Changes since `20241018GT_KSW` built 12 days earlier:
- Mentions of Qualcomm SC668S platform; there's also an internal event `ZXW_ACTION_CHANGE_SYSTEM_VERSION_TO_668S` which would be followed with a tooltip message saying that version will be replaced (or reverted) after a restart
- Ivicar (360 camera) app: Mentions of "quick reverse state" feature based on `frvcState=1` value in `/early_splash/etc/ais_camera_response.conf` file
- More Ukrainian translations
- Theme [`KSW_BENZ_LS`](/headunits/themes/zxw/48-ksw_benz_ls) with `id="48"` has even wider support across various apps
- Mentions of air conditioning feature with left/right fans toggles and speeds, wind direction, temperature, etc.
- Mentions of "auto park status" feature
- Some internal changes to enable Android voice integration service, e.g. Google Assistant
- Downgraded built-in Chrome APK from v111.0.5563.116 to v100.0.4896.88 (?)
- The `zxw_factory_config.xml` and `zxw_lcd.xml` are now embedded in firmware. They are very unlikely to be actually used, since that would mean everyone would have to have their own personalised firmware upgrade ZIP files. It's possible that they were just put there by a mistake. Embedded version was for BMW with `KSW-BM-20220815.0.cn` containing more [factory settings](/headunits/factory-settings/zxw) that we were aware of.
