Summary:
- New themes [`KSW_BMW_ID8_GS_DOUBLE`](/headunits/themes/zxw/53-ksw_bmw_id8_gs_double) and [`KSW_BENZ_GLC`](/headunits/themes/zxw/54-ksw_benz_glc)

Changes since `20241214GT_KSW` built 21 days earlier:
- New theme [`KSW_BMW_ID8_GS_DOUBLE`](/headunits/themes/zxw/53-ksw_bmw_id8_gs_double) with `id="53"` with a secondary screen support in the launcher, containing various information like live GPS data
- New theme [`KSW_BENZ_GLC`](/headunits/themes/zxw/54-ksw_benz_glc) with `id="54"` as a second theme so far with navigation bar support, like [`KSW_BENZ_VITO`](/headunits/themes/zxw/52-ksw_benz_vito)
