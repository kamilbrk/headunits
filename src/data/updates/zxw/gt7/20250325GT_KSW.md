Summary:
- New theme [`KSW_BENZ_FY3`](/headunits/themes/zxw/55-ksw_benz_fy3)
- Zlink app updated from `5.4.45` to `5.4.96`
- New "External mic output" factory setting

Changes since `20250104GT_KSW` built 80 days earlier:
- New theme [`KSW_BENZ_FY3`](/headunits/themes/zxw/55-ksw_benz_fy3) with `id="55"` with blue, green, orange, purple, red and yellow options that looks to be relatively well-supported by most built-in apps. Seems to require `ALS_6208` client value and potentially have a lyrics functionality in the Music app.
- Initial changes to for upcoming [`KSW_BMW_ID9`](/headunits/themes/zxw/56-ksw_bmw_id9) with `id="56"`, although it's not implemented in various apps yet
- Zlink app updated from `5.4.45` to `5.4.96` with minor UI updates and screen DPI settings for Huawei HiCar mode. Activities are now marked as resizeable.
- New "External mic output" (`<externalMicOutput>`) factory setting in Function section with "I2S" and "AUX" options, which will change output device ID in AudioManager
- New "Car without gear information" (`<withoutGearInfo>`) factory setting in Vehicle section
- New "Mercedes Benz Vito bottom status bar style" (`<benzVitoBottomStyle>`) factory setting in Special Benz section with "Default" and "Temperature Control" options
- Updated various translations
- More work for the upcoming "FIBO" platform. Existing GT7/GT7Pro variations were on `CPM-KSW-001` whereas the board value for GT7_FIBO/GT7Pro_FIBO is `FIB-KSW-001`.
- Zlink on FIBO platform will be potentially replaced with `com.szchoiceway.zxwlink` (CarPlay), `com.sykj.fusionlink` (Android Auto) and `com.sykj.hicar` (Huawei HiCar) packages instead.
- Added new file extensions that media apps will be scanning for: `.dsf`, `.dst` and `.dff` for audio and `.rm` for video files
- Allow list of apps that are permitted to stream music is now extracted to a standalone file under `/system/etc/force_music_stream.txt`, although still contains the same package names as before: `com.papago.s10BU`, `com.nng.igo.primong.hun10th`, `com.nng.igo.primong.igoworld`, `com.nng.igo.primong.palestine` and `com.basarsoft.igonextgen.javaclient`
- Similarly, block list of apps where notifications are not permitted is now extracted to `/system/etc/blacklist_notification.txt` although such file does not exist yet
- ApkInstall app updated to disable all caps text on buttons
- Swapped build server to Jenkins CI
