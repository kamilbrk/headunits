This appears to be the only theme that might require the CUSP client, although it doesn't seem like it would change much in terms of functionality. Well, perhaps other than swapping the order of apps in the launcher, although piece of code appears to be for the KswPLauncher on Benz MBUX themes, so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
